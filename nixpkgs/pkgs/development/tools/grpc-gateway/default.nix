      This is a plugin for the Google Protocol Buffers compiler (protoc). It reads
      protobuf service definitions and generates a reverse-proxy server which
      translates a RESTful HTTP API into gRPC. This server is generated according to
      the google.api.http annotations in the protobuf service definitions.
